# Americano

A simple macOS menu bar app that controls the caffeinate command. When activated, it prevents your Mac from sleeping, dimming the display, or starting the screensaver.

## Motivation

I created this project for fun and as an alternative to the Amphetamine app available on the Apple App Store. While Amphetamine offers similar functionality, I wanted to create a solution with a more neutral name that doesn't have drug-related connotations.

## Features

- Toggle caffeinate with a single click
- Menu bar icon changes to reflect the current state

## Future Plans

In future versions, I plan to stop relying on the macOS caffeinate program and rewrite my own caffeinate equivalent in Rust for fun. This will give me more control over the functionality and serve as an interesting learning experience.

## Security Note

Since this app needs to run the `caffeinate` command, users might need to grant it permission in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Automation.
